## Background and Purpose
With the use data from the AQUASTAT Database, this visualization aims to inform people of the disparities in drinking water around the world. Although clean drinking water is a necessity in life, not everyone has access to it, and there is an even clearer distinction between those living in urban and rural areas. This project uses a choropleth to geographically show the percentage of the population with clean drinking water for both urban and rural areas, which provides a better understanding of where the regions of water disparity are located. It also uses bar charts to help show the water disparity for selected countries of interest.

## Data Used
- [AQUASTAT data](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/query/): Access to improved drinking water source for all countries and all available years (only 2015 in this case)
- [All countries in the world in geoJSON format](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/blob/master/countries.geo.json)

## Tools Used
- D3.js
